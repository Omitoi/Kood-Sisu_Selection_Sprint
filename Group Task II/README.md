# Notetool 

The Notetool is here for you to write down your ideas shortly to memorize them later. You can either list your ideas in short notes and save them for later or you can view and delete earlier notes.

## Commands
- `1. Show notes`: Display all notes in the collection.
- `2. Add a note`: Add a new note to the collection.
- `3. Delete a note`: Remove a note from the collection.
- `4. Exit`: Exit the tool.

## Data Storage
Each collection is stored as a plain text file with the same name as the collection. Notes are stored in separate rows within the file, and the data persists between runs of the tool.
