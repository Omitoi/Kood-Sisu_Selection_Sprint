This program is designed to encrypt or decrypt the text you input. First you can choose which operation you want to proceed with.
Second step is to choose an encryption method. Third step is to enter the text you want proceed with. 

There are three different encryption possibilities:
* First option is the ROT13 which will shift each character 13 steps forward in the alphabet. 
* Second Reverse which will switch each character to the opposite one in the alphabet. For example the letter 'a' to 'z' or number '0' to '9'.
* Third option is an encryption using a variable key, enter your input message and key for your future use to Decrypt the result. 
  The key you input will be used to create the new encrypted message

All of these options are also available to decrypt the text if needed. For the key code encryption remember to note down your key, we will not be responsible for your forgotten key. It will not be stored for your safety.

★★★★✰ | satisfied_user983 - will use again. 

★★★★★ | Not_a_bot536 - this program has changed my life. Thanks to this I have found a wife and a degree and this just is the best thing in the world
